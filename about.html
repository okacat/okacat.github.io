        <p>
    I'm Oskar and this is my website I made to have a way of sharing the random projects, photos and other things I get up to. 
</p>

<p>
    I do Android development at work and in my personal time I tend to gravitate towards developing video games and occasionally other small software or hardware projects.
    While out on trips I like to take photos as well.
    I've also been brewing beer with my girlfriend and friends for a while, as well as other fermentation experiments such as ginger beer and doboroku(sake).
</p>

<p>
    Feel free to drop by in the future as well, hopefully there will be some new things to see.
