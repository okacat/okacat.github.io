        <h1>Raytracer</h1>

<p>
I had an old version of 3dsmax on my computer when I was a kid that I could play around with and use to make some basic renders.
3D graphics seemed like pure magic.
I didn't understand how any of it worked, I just followed one of the many tutorials of the old internet, hit "render", heard the PC fans speed up, and waited for the picture to appear.
Years later I realized that people actually make raytracers completely from scratch, and ever since, I wanted to write one myself.
I stumbled upon a great book, <a href="https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html">Ray Tracing in One Weekend </a> by Peter Shirley, and it was the perfect excuse to finally do it.
</p>

<p>
I chose Go as I've been wanting to try it for a while. 
It has a built-in concurrency model, which worked great for an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embarrassingly_parallel">embarrassingly parallel</a> problem such as ray tracing. 
I like the language in general, it was very easy to get started with it and they have a nice tour of it on <a href="https://tour.golang.org/welcome">https://tour.golang.org</a>.
</p>

<p>
I'm pretty happy with the results, seeing images appear from code you've written is always exciting.
Of course, there are a million things that I'd like to add and improve, but this was meant as just a fun exercise.
</p>

<p>
I added an <code>.obj</code> parser to it, so I was able to load and render simple triangulated scenes. 
But as I made absolutely no attempts at optimizing things, any scene with more than a few triangles renders painfully slow.
</p>

<p>
The code is available on <a href="https://github.com/okacat/raytracer-go">Github</a>.

Here are the results:
