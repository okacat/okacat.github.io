<p>
Hungry Rabbits is a game Karin and I made for Ludum Dare 41 in 2018 (more about Ludum Dare in the <a href="intersection.html">Intersection</a> article).
The theme this time was <i>Combine 2 Incompatible Genres</i>.
We thought a card game + farming simulator would be a fun thing to try:
</p>

<blockquote>
Grow as many plants as you can, while fending off hungry rabbits, draught, and unwanted insects. 
Each crop is worth a different amount of golden coins, all very accurately resembling the price in your local grocery store. 
If you ever wanted to test your farming skills through a card game, here’s your chance!
</blockquote>

<p>
The game is played by drawing cards from either the "seeds" or the "tools" pile.
The seeds you plant on one of the 4 plots, and then they grow a bit every turn. 
Different plants need a different amount of turns to get to a point when you can harvest them.
To harvest plants, you need a "basket" card.
This means you have to balance between picking from the "tools" or the "seeds" pile.
Each turn there is also a chance that your plot gets attacked by hungry rabbits, drought or bugs.
To prevent the plant from getting eaten, you need an appropriate tool card to play - fence, watering can or ladybugs.

It was great fun working on the game together.
Karin made the graphics for the cards in watercolors, and I focused on the programming.
In terms of scores, we ended up in 520th place overall, out of 2017 entries. 
We did get some nice comments from players though!
